## Building the source

For prerequisites and detailed build instructions please read the [Installation Instructions](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/getting-started/installing-geth).

Building `geth` requires both a Go (version 1.24 or later) and a C compiler (GCC 5 or higher). You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

```shell
make geth
```

or, to build the full suite of utilities:

```shell
make all
```

## Executables

The go-ethereum project comes with several wrappers/executables found in the `cmd`
directory.

|  Command   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :--------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`geth`** | Our main Ethereum CLI client. It is the entry point into the Ethereum network (main-, test- or private net), capable of running as a full node (default), archive node (retaining all historical state) or a light node (retrieving data live). It can be used by other processes as a gateway into the Ethereum network via JSON RPC endpoints exposed on top of HTTP, WebSocket and/or IPC transports. `geth --help` and the [CLI page](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/command-line-options) for command line options. |
|   `clef`   | Stand-alone signing tool, which can be used as a backend signer for `geth`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  `devp2p`  | Utilities to interact with nodes on the networking layer, without running a full blockchain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  `abigen`  | Source code generator to convert Ethereum contract definitions into easy-to-use, compile-time type-safe Go packages. It operates on plain [Ethereum contract ABIs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/abi-spec.html) with expanded functionality if the contract bytecode is also available. However, it also accepts Solidity source files, making development much more streamlined. Please see our [Native DApps](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/developers/dapp-developer/native-bindings) page for details.                                  |
| `bootnode` | Stripped down version of our Ethereum client implementation that only takes part in the network node discovery protocol, but does not run any of the higher level application protocols. It can be used as a lightweight bootstrap node to aid in finding peers in private networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|   `evm`    | Developer utility version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that is capable of running bytecode snippets within a configurable environment and execution mode. Its purpose is to allow isolated, fine-grained debugging of EVM opcodes (e.g. `evm --code 60ff60ff --debug run`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `rlpdump`  | Developer utility tool to convert binary RLP ([Recursive Length Prefix](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp)) dumps (data encoding used by the Ethereum protocol both network as well as consensus wise) to user-friendlier hierarchical representation (e.g. `rlpdump --hex CE0183FFFFFFC4C304050583616263`).                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Configuration

All validator need to process following steps.
All full node installation requires **only `1`** in steps.

1. [Run geth client](https://docs.oasys.games/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/build-validator-node)
2. [Join PoS system & delegage](https://docs.oasys.games/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/join-validator)
3. [Run verifier](https://docs.oasys.games/docs/hub-validator/operate-validator/setup-verifier)

### Programmatically interfacing `geth` nodes

As a developer, sooner rather than later you'll want to start interacting with `geth` and the
Ethereum network via your own programs and not manually through the console. To aid
this, `geth` has built-in support for a JSON-RPC based APIs ([standard APIs](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/)
and [`geth` specific APIs](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc)).
These can be exposed via HTTP, WebSockets and IPC (UNIX sockets on UNIX based
platforms, and named pipes on Windows).

The IPC interface is enabled by default and exposes all the APIs supported by `geth`,
whereas the HTTP and WS interfaces need to manually be enabled and only expose a
subset of APIs due to security reasons. These can be turned on/off and configured as
you'd expect.

HTTP based JSON-RPC API options:

  * `--http` Enable the HTTP-RPC server
  * `--http.addr` HTTP-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--http.port` HTTP-RPC server listening port (default: `8545`)
  * `--http.api` API's offered over the HTTP-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--http.corsdomain` Comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests (browser enforced)
  * `--ws` Enable the WS-RPC server
  * `--ws.addr` WS-RPC server listening interface (default: `localhost`)
  * `--ws.port` WS-RPC server listening port (default: `8546`)
  * `--ws.api` API's offered over the WS-RPC interface (default: `eth,net,web3`)
  * `--ws.origins` Origins from which to accept WebSocket requests
  * `--ipcdisable` Disable the IPC-RPC server
  * `--ipcapi` API's offered over the IPC-RPC interface (default: `admin,debug,eth,miner,net,personal,txpool,web3`)
  * `--ipcpath` Filename for IPC socket/pipe within the datadir (explicit paths escape it)

You'll need to use your own programming environments' capabilities (libraries, tools, etc) to
connect via HTTP, WS or IPC to a `geth` node configured with the above flags and you'll
need to speak [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) on all transports. You
can reuse the same connection for multiple requests!

**Note: Please understand the security implications of opening up an HTTP/WS based
transport before doing so! Hackers on the internet are actively trying to subvert
Ethereum nodes with exposed APIs! Further, all browser tabs can access locally
running web servers, so malicious web pages could try to subvert locally available
APIs!**

#### Defining the private genesis state

First, you'll need to create the genesis state of your networks, which all nodes need to be
aware of and agree upon. This consists of a small JSON file (e.g. call it `genesis.json`):

```json
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": <arbitrary positive integer>,
    "homesteadBlock": 0,
    "eip150Block": 0,
    "eip155Block": 0,
    "eip158Block": 0,
    "byzantiumBlock": 0,
    "constantinopleBlock": 0,
    "petersburgBlock": 0,
    "istanbulBlock": 0,
    "berlinBlock": 0,
    "londonBlock": 0
  },
  "alloc": {},
  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "difficulty": "0x20000",
  "extraData": "",
  "gasLimit": "0x2fefd8",
  "nonce": "0x0000000000000042",
  "mixhash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "timestamp": "0x00"
}
```

With the genesis state defined in the GENSIS.JSON file, you'll need to initialize **every**
`geth` node with it prior to starting it up to ensure all blockchain parameters are correctly
set:

```shell
$ geth init path/to/genesis.json
```

*Note: You could also use a full-fledged `geth` node as a bootnode, but it's the less
recommended way.*

#### Creating the rendezvous point

With all nodes that you want to run initialized to the desired genesis state, you'll need to
start a bootstrap node that others can use to find each other in your network and/or over
the internet. The clean way is to configure and run a dedicated bootnode:

```shell
$ bootnode --genkey=boot.key
$ bootnode --nodekey=boot.key
```

With the bootnode online, it will display an [`enode` URL](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networking-layer/network-addresses/#enode)
that other nodes can use to connect to it and exchange peer information. Make sure to
replace the displayed IP address information (most probably `[::]`) with your externally
accessible IP to get the actual `enode` URL.

*Note: You could also use a full-fledged `geth` node as a bootnode, but it's the less
recommended way.*

#### Starting up your member nodes

With the bootnode operational and externally reachable (you can try
`telnet <ip> <port>` to ensure it's indeed reachable), start every subsequent `geth`
node pointed to the bootnode for peer discovery via the `--bootnodes` flag. It will
probably also be desirable to keep the data directory of your private network separated, so
do also specify a custom `--datadir` flag.

```shell
$ geth --datadir=path/to/custom/data/folder --bootnodes=<bootnode-enode-url-from-above>
```

*Note: Since your network will be completely cut off from the main and test networks, you'll
also need to configure a miner to process transactions and create new blocks for you.*

#### Running a private miner


In a private network setting a single CPU miner instance is more than enough for
practical purposes as it can produce a stable stream of blocks at the correct intervals
without needing heavy resources (consider running on a single thread, no need for multiple
ones either). To start a `geth` instance for mining, run it with all your usual flags, extended
by:

```shell
$ geth <usual-flags> --mine --miner.threads=1 --miner.etherbase=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Which will start mining blocks and transactions on a single CPU thread, crediting all
proceedings to the account specified by `--miner.etherbase`. You can further tune the mining
by changing the default gas limit blocks converge to (`--miner.targetgaslimit`) and the price
transactions are accepted at (`--miner.gasprice`).
